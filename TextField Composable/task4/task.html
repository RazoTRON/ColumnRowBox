<h2>Error field # Application</h2>

<p>In this task, you need to create a composable <code>PasswordField</code> which state must be in error&nbsp;if user enters less than 8 characters (in this case, the field is displayed in error color).&nbsp;Also, the field should contain a hint with the text &quot;<em>Password</em>&quot;, which should disappear as soon as the user enters the first character on this field as shown in the example:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="77" name="password field.gif" src="https://ucarecdn.com/81620e18-97f6-4d15-8d1b-2ac863bc9c61/" width="358" /></p>
